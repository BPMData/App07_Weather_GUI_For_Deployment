# A simple weather forecasting application!
## Made as an exercise in using API calls together.
This app runs off of two APIs:  
One API converts the entered city name (and country and state names, if provided) into a pair of latitutde and longitude coordinates.  
The other API retrieves the appropriate weather data for those coordinates for the specified number of days.
